## TRY IT YOURSELF

### EXERCISES

**1.1 – Python.org**
Explore the Python home page ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)) to find topics that interest you. As you become more familiar with Python, different parts of the site will become more useful.

**1.2 – Hello World Typos**
Open the `hello_world.py` file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again.

* Can you make a typo that generates an error?
* Can you understand the error message?
* Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error?
* Why do you think it didn’t generate an error?

**1.3 – Infinite Skills**
If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You’re about to learn how to program, and having an end goal will help you immediately apply your new skills. This is a great time to draft descriptions of what you’d like to create.

Take a few minutes to describe three programs you’d like to build.

## ANSWERS

### 1.1 – Python.org

Some interesting resources I found on the website:

* [https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
* [https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [https://www.python.org/jobs/](https://www.python.org/jobs/)
* [https://pypi.org/search/](https://pypi.org/search/)

### 1.2 – Hello World Typos

Files used in this exercise:

* `./hello_world.py`
* `./hello_world_error.py`

### 1.3 – Infinite Skills

If I had infinite programming skills, I would focus on:

* Connecting people with interesting ideas but little or no money, through a new kind of social media.
* Building a game to be played with friends, focused not on the destination, but on the laughs along the way.
* Creating a tool that better connects SQL and NoSQL databases in a fast and highly scalable way.
* (EXTRA): A system that helps humans make better long-term decisions. Tools that simulate consequences, social, environmental, personal, so people can see the future impact of choices before making them.
